Adding ancestral allele to vcf file can be run using the fill-aa script (provided in the folder) using similar command as follow:
$ cat chr_29.vcf | fill-aa -a cattle_aa_29 2>test.err | gzip -c > 29_with_aa.vcf.gz
For above command running in linux, input file is chr_29.vcf with ancestral allele cattle_aa_29; final file is named 29_with_aa.vcf.gz.
